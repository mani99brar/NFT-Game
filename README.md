# NFT-Game

I built a two-player battle game using cutting-edge technologies such as React, Solidity, and Web3.
The game leverages the unique properties of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to create a truly unique and engaging experience for players. 
By utilizing React, I was able to create a smooth and interactive user interface that is both aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly. 
Solidity was used to build smart contracts that govern the game logic, making it secure and decentralized. 
Finally, Web3 was utilized to connect the game to the blockchain, providing a seamless and trustless experience for players.
